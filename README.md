# ALevel-Project

A Dockerised version of my A-Level programming project. Currently this is a version slightly older
than the one I submitted since I have lost the most up-to-date version, but I will try to recover
it. As far as I can remember, this contains all features, but lacks graphics in some places and is
rougher round the edges. My main impetus for uploading this was to practise using Docker to make
applications portable.

To start, run:

docker-compose up --build -d

If it fails the first time, try again
