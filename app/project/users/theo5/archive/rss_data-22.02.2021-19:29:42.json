Josef said she was asked to take her 4-year-old sister Saada to a health clinic and leave her there. When she returned several hours later, she was told her sister was dead and the family was given no further details or a body to bury. The Israeli government has approved a plan to offer $50 million in compensation to the families of hundreds of Yemenite children who disappeared in the early years of the country's establishment. But the announcement on Monday, Feb. 22, 2021, received a cool reception from advocacy groups that said the government had failed to apologize or accept responsibility for the affair.

New York Rangers star Artemi Panarin is taking a leave of absence after a Russian tabloid printed allegations from a former coach that he attacked an 18-year-old woman in Latvia in 2011. Ex-NHL enforcer Andrei Nazarov is the source for the report after coaching Panarin in the Kontinental Hockey League. Nazarov says he was motivated to speak about it because he disagreed with Panarin's repeated criticism of the Russian government. Panarin denied the allegations in a statement released by the Rangers. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)"
