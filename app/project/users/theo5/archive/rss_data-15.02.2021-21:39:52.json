Andrew Cuomo delivers his State of the State address virtually from The War Room at the state Capitol, in Albany, N.Y. In the name of fairness, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and his Democratic allies once welcomed the creation of a nonpartisan redistricting commission that would redraw congressional maps free of political influence and avoid contorted gerrymandering.  But now that the commission is stepping up its work, New York Democrats seem to be having second thoughts. The state may lose House seats and, under the old rules, Democrats would have had the power to redraw lines in their favor.  (AP Photo/Hans Pennink, Pool, File)"
